Fake news detection:
Fake news are the news stories which are false. This kind of news mainly popularize in social media, twitter and Facebook by sharing, and this kind of news mainly create to mislead the readers, or damaging reputation of any particular entity. The news/stories itself is fabricated with no sources, facts and quotes. This kind of fake news is one of the greatest threats to many individuals and for everyone who takes that. By the researchers we can clearly say that fake news spread more than the fact news, so it is much more important to find which news is fact and real.
Here, the main purpose of this project is to detect fake news. So, we use different textual properties which can be used to distinguish fake contents from real contents, by using those properties, we can train a combination of different machine learning algorithms using various ensemble methods.
Algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Support vector Machine
Multilayer Perceptron
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
Ensemble Learners
Random forest
Bagging Ensemble Classifiers
